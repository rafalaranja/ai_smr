 I've had a bit of a habit of doing just this upper portion of the rep and like going, you know, really heavy. So I'm still doing work, but it's just a completely different feeling to actually take the weight all the way down to like 90. You know, have the staff almost, you know, bottom out and then fire all the way to the top, which I guess is common knowledge. But, you know, for me, range of motion, it almost comes second to intensity for me.
